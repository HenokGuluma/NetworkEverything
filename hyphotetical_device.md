The device I imagined is a bracelet kind of tag synchronized with electrical outlets within a house that babies can wear
and lets the parents know when the baby is in close proximity with these electrical outlets. This reduces the odds of babies 
being accidentally electrocuted whenever they are wondering around a house. 

This IoT device is in sync with the bracelet, perhaps a phone of the parents and some electrical appliances deemed dangerous 
for babies to stumble upon.

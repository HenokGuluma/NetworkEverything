Ring to bail someone from a social situation

Our product helps people escape social situations they are not comfortable in. 
The ring is connected to their phone and whenever they feel like they want to get out of the context they are in, 
they could press a hidden button on the ring. This button will send a signal so that their phone fakes a call. 
The consumer can pretend it is an emergency and leave, or could use it as an excuse to change the topic of the conversation
after the phone call is over.

This product could be used by anyone, as long as every ring looks different so that people cannot identify whether it’s an 
emergency ring or not.

The product is both a tool and a service. 

The tool part is the physical hardware aspect which constitutes of a ring fitted with a button. This button when pressed
will send a signal to the microprocessor which in turn sends a signal via WIFI to a cell phone. 

The service aspect of the project is where the signal received from the microprocessor triggers a fake emergency phone call.   
The actor is anyone who wears this ring. Stakeholders are the people who are fooled that there is an emergency on the phone. 
Hopefully, they won’t find out that they are being fooled.

The ring is meant to be worn on a regular and daily basis and hence needs to be very comfortable and wearable in any weather 
conditions. So it should be as simple as possible, waterproof, dust resistant, and generally durable.

  Questions: 

How often do you encounter social situations you immediately want to get out of? 

If you are guaranteed a way to avoid uncomfortable social situations, would you be try to be more sociable? 

Are you comfortable in wearing a ring like product on a daily basis. 

What about a bracelet?

After getting the feedback from the consumer market, specially regarding the choice between a ring or a bracelet, 
we move to the manufacturing process. The challenge we have regarding the ring is finding a microprocessor small 
enough to fit the ring. 

On the other hand, a bracelet will provide a bigger room to house the microprocessor and 
hence a better chance of finding a microprocessor big enough to have all the necessary modules (including WIFI module).

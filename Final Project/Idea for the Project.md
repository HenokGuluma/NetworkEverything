## IDEA FOR FINAL PROJECT

  My idea for the final project is a two-player gaming device I like to call "Shoot the Duck 2.0". Each player will have a side that faces
the opponent, that contains a shooting device and 8 ducks lined up horizontally. Although the number of the duck models is eight, it is 
in reality one duck running from one side to the other. This can be simulated through the duck models lighting up in a pattern that 
imitates the running process. The goal is to shoot the lit up duck before your opponent shoots yours. It will be a score based system and 
whoever reaches a score of 10 wins.

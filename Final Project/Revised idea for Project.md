#The Revised Idea 

    The new idea I have is a combination of a device and a music playing website. The device consists of two rotating knobs, a button and 
    some LEDs. And the website is a typical online music player website, which can be implemented via a music API. The device acts as
    a mini remote, where it can control the background and text color of the website by one of the rotating knobs and it can control the
    volume of the music playing by the other knob. 
    
    If the user wants to raise or lower the volume of the music but isn't in proximity of their computer or laptop, this device can let 
    them do so easily. Another functionality is that if the volume raises above a certain volume, the website can send a signal to the 
    device which basically makes the LEDs blink to signal  that the volume is too high. 
    
    System components: 
      Arduino MKR1010
      Server.js
      Client.js
      Index.html
      Probably some CSS for the web design
      Music API
      Potentiometers(knobs), buttons and LEDs

#The Revised Idea 

The new idea I have is a combination of a device and a music playing website. The device consists of two rotating knobs, a button and 
some LEDs. And the website is a typical online music player website, which can be implemented via a music API. The device acts as
a mini remote, where it can control the background and text color of the website by one of the rotating knobs and it can control the
volume of the music playing by the other knob. 
    
If the user wants to raise or lower the volume of the music but isn't in proximity of their computer or laptop, this device can let 
them do so easily. Another functionality is that if the volume raises above a certain volume, the website can send a signal to the 
device which basically makes the LEDs blink to signal  that the volume is too high. 
    
System components:
1. Arduino MKR1010
2. Server.js
3. Client.js
4. Index.html
5. Probably some CSS for the web design
6. Music API
7. Potentiometers(knobs), buttons and LEDs

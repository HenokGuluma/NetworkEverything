The device I wanted to build is a home monitoring device. I want to implement either one or both of the following functionalities
for this device. One functionality is a door-bell notification system that sends a signal to a device whenever the automatic 
door-bell is rang. The user can therefore monitor from anywhere if someone is at his/her doorstep. Another functionality is a 
temperature sensing system that lets a person know if they left some kitchen appliances such as stoves and ovens on by accident
and helps keep the house safe.  

The first part of the project is relatively easier as it just requires a button that sends signals to an audio output device 
and a smartphone device. The second part involves using temperature sensors and configuring them to detect temperatures above
a certain value and send a signal to a smartphone. 

This device contains interoperable and interusable systems that are fairly easy to use and rarely interfere with each other. It 
is practical in terms of solving some common issues everyone faces in their daily lives.

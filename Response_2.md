# Designing Connected Products 

## Response to reading

#### 
This chapter generally discusses how user experience design is like when it comes to Internet of Things. It emphasizes the point
that the ultimate goal of manufacturers of IOT devices is for consumers to feel like they are using a coherent service rather than
using different user interfaces that are disjointed. And hence, it is important to think about not just usability but interusability
as well. And also while applying IOT in our day to day lives, we may encounter different challenges which can range from random glitches
that arise from problems in the internet to asynchronous behavior and so on. And hence it poses this question of whether it is worth it
to have such an internet based connected system of devices.

In order to overcome some of the challenges mentioned, it is necessary to think of new ways of design to shape UX( user experience design)
. And it maybe useful to think of a user experience diagram that explains how different design specialities are linked together.
Such a model has elements that are least visible to the user but lie at the core of it. One example of such element is the platform 
design. On the other hand the most visible elements include user interface designs such as screen layout, look and feel of the devices.
